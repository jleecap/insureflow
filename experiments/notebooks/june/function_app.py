        1. Read the submitted data (email and other information) submitted by the broker.
        2. Categorize the submission into one of these Lines of Business (LoB):
            - Business Owner's Policy (BOP)
            - Commercial Auto
            - General Liability

        4. Use the read_property_template_data tool to retrieve the template for the identified LoB
        5. Compare the submission against the template to identify any missing information
        6. Document your findings using record_notes tool. The notes should including:

            - Complete information provided
            - Missing information
            - Any anomalies or concerns with the submission

        Do a detailed analysis of the submission and ensure you are thorough in your review before taking notes.
        After completing your analysis, hand over to the EmailAgent with your findings for further processing and client communication.
